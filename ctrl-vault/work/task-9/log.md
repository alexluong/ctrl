# TASK-9 log: changes and undo

Design: `design.md`. Newest at the bottom. Each change has its undo.

## 2026-10-03

**Decisions (Alex)**
- Tailnet: keep `lhtanh98@gmail.com` (`tail2b958c.ts.net`). The Mini stays logged in at `100.91.137.41`.
- `iphone-15-pro` is Alex's current phone: keep. `67ee56ee4fc5` and `poc-client` can be removed (Alex, in the admin console; not blocking).
- Hannah's devices: on this tailnet later, media only. Out of scope for the proof.

**Found (read-only)**
- `gw` (container 110, unprivileged, `nesting=1`): no `/dev/net/tun`, `net.ipv4.ip_forward = 0`, empty nftables ruleset (all accept), Tailscale not installed.
- `g8`: `/dev/net/tun` exists (10,200), Proxmox 9.2.21.
- `hookdeck-ws`: `/dev/net/tun` exists, Tailscale not installed.
- MBP: Tailscale not installed.
- Userspace mode on `gw` does not fit option 2: with no `tailscale0` interface the kernel has nothing to forward home traffic into. The tun device is needed.

**Changes**
- none yet
